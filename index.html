<h3>Basics of Web</h3>
<p>Computers that send requests to servers to access web pages.
The server finds the <em>HTML</em> associated with the web page based 
on the request and sends it back to the originator. 
The userâ€™s browser will then interpret the web page 
and display on the computer. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> explains the 
interaction.

<h3>World Wide Web (www) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h3>
<p>World Wide Web uses HTML to connect the webpages. <em>HTML</em> is the 
heart of the web, its text content, markup (how it looks), references to
documents (images and videos), and links to other web pages.
</p>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Tags are used to create the <em>HTML</em> code. Depending on the tag, 
you will have opening and/or closing tags, some tags we have used so far in
 module 0 are bold, emphasis, anchor, and linkable tags consisting 
both of websites or images.

<h2>Structure and Style</h2>

<div class="notes">
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>There are 3 types of Code Language, HTML <em>(Hypertext Markup Language)
</em>,CSS <em>(Cascading Style Sheet)</em>, and JS <em>(Java Script)</em>. 
HTML controls the structure of the page while CSS controls the style of the 
page.</p>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The DOM <em>(Document Object Model)</em> is what they call the tree like 
structure of the page. Both HTML and CSS both are languages that based
on syntax and rules. It contains opening tag, content and closing tag. 
Each tag has a name <em>(type)</em> such as paragraph, image, or division.
Content can be empty text or other element. Documents written in 
HTML defines the content and structure. </p>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>CSS is the language of style in coding. With CSS, you can define the 
font, color, border, position, etc. You can boxify a design, usually 
separated by header, body and footer.</p>

<h3>Types of tools used for Coding</h3>
<p>
There are 3 type of tools used for coding. <em>Scratch Pad, Code Pen, 
and Sublime</em>. On speed of feedback, Scratchpad is immediate,
Code Pen is 2-3 seconds, and Sublime is on page refresh. On ease of sharing
Scratchpad is impossible, Code Pen is easy but requires an account, Sublime is difficult. On power and professionalism, Scratch pad is low, Code Pen is very high, and Sublime is the highest. And on the number of languages, Scratchpad has 2 <em>(HTML and CSS)</em>, Code pen has 3 <em>(HTML, CSS, and JS)</em>, while Sublime does all the languages.

<h3>CSS Style</h3>
<p>
CSS is language to add style to your HTML. One key feature of CSS is
<em>inheritance</em>. This the mechanism by which properties are applied to not only to the specified element, but also its descendants. Inheritance allows developers to write less CSS language. 
</p>
<p>
The Box Model is what every programmer should focus on when creating 
language for CSS. The box model consists of starting from the inside out is
the <em>Content, Padding, Border and the Margins</em>. Box sizing, positioning,
and adding images are styles to make your webpage your own.

<h3>Code, Test, and Refine</h3>
<p>
A good way to start thinking like a programmer is to use these 5 steps to achieve your webpage.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>1. Look for natural boxes <li>2. Look for repeated styles and syntax<li>3. Write 
  your HTML<li>4. Apply you style (from biggest to smallest)<li>5. Fix things.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Repeat steps 3 to 5 to achieve the webpage you desire.</p>
